This is an Undergraduate Research Work for the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo:
This research work focuses on developing new communication tools for the UPRA administration. Currently, the administration uses inefficient methods to send and present information to the students. Some of the complaints students and administration had been expressive about throughout the years are:  a) Not enough students are aware of the information the administration puts out periodically or when the official calendar is amended. b) The official calendar is in pdf format, and not dynamic as it cannot be edited. c) Updates are sent in multiple emails a day. Because of the disorganization of the material being sent, students had taken action on creating unofficial tools like a facebook page, which proved to be more effective than the administration’s approach. To solve the listed problems, we opted to develop a calendar application.

The calendar application would allow immediate communication of changes in the official academic calendar. The users could choose and filter the information which is relevant to them, receiving notifications of changes and updates directly to the application. The app would also give reminders of dates important to the user. To begin with this project we’ll be developing our first prototype for iOS mobile devices using the Swift programming language. These, and many other features like giving the university administration the tools to send instant notifications of any changes made in the calendar, instead of recurring to previous methods, will help students and the administration alike to keep track of all important dates in the university’s system.
